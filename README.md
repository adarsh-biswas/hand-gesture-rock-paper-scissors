# Rock-Paper-Scissors with Hand Gesture Recognition

This project is a Python-based game of Rock-Paper-Scissors that uses a webcam and the MediaPipe library to recognize hand gestures in real-time. It allows players to compete against a computer opponent by showing gestures for "rock," "paper," or "scissors."

## Features
- Real-time hand gesture recognition using a webcam.
- Automatic detection of "rock," "paper," and "scissors" gestures.
- Computer-generated moves for gameplay.
- Display of results on the screen (win, lose, or tie).
- Press `q` to quit the game.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:
- Python 3.7 or later
- A functional webcam

### Required Python Packages
