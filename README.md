# Rock-Paper-Scissors with Hand Gestures

This project allows you to play a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors using hand gestures. The application utilizes **MediaPipe** for hand gesture recognition and **OpenCV** for capturing and processing the webcam feed. The game prompts the user to show a gesture, and it then compares the user's gesture with a randomly selected computer gesture to determine the winner.

## Features

- **Gesture Recognition**: Detects "Rock", "Paper", and "Scissors" gestures using hand landmarks.
- **Game Logic**: Plays a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game between the user and the computer.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Displays the result (Win, Loss, or Tie) on the screen.
- **Camera Integration**: Uses the webcam to detect the hand gestures.
